# City Content Generation Guide

## Purpose
This guide helps you create unique, SEO-optimized content for each city page to reduce duplicate content from 30%+ to ~10%.

## Variation Factors

Each city should have unique content based on these 5 factors:

### 1. Environmental Angle
Consider the local environment and how it affects garage doors:
- **coastal-humidity**: Near Gulf Coast (salt air, high humidity, rust concerns)
- **agricultural-dust**: Farming/rural areas (dust resistance, heavy use)
- **industrial-coastal**: Near industrial zones (corrosion, security, 24/7 needs)
- **suburban-residential**: Typical residential areas (aesthetics, HOA compliance)
- **urban-commercial**: Business districts (security, frequent use, traffic)

### 2. Technical Focus
What technical aspect to emphasize for this city:
- **corrosion-resistance**: Coastal areas with salt air
- **durability-heavy-use**: High-traffic/commercial areas
- **hurricane-rating-security**: Storm-prone areas
- **insulation-energy**: Temperature extremes
- **smart-technology**: Tech-forward communities

### 3. Tone Archetype
The personality and voice of the content:
- **hometown-trust**: "Your neighbors, founded here, local roots"
- **hardworking-reliable**: "No-nonsense, practical, gets the job done"
- **industrial-professional**: "Technical expertise, certified, professional"
- **family-friendly**: "Warm, community-focused, family values"
- **modern-innovative**: "Cutting-edge, smart technology, forward-thinking"

### 4. Local Proof
Specific local credibility markers:
- Local address or landmark references
- Years serving the specific community
- Local testimonials or project examples
- Community involvement (events, sponsorships)
- Understanding of local regulations/HOAs

### 5. Custom CTA Phrasing
Vary your call-to-action language:
- "Call Your Liberty Neighbors"
- "Request Dayton Service"
- "Schedule Baytown Consultation"
- "Get Your [City] Quote"
- "Connect with [City] Experts"
- "Protect Your [City] Investment"
