## ✅ Rules

Never use <a> tags always use the pre-made <Link> tag 

In HTML/JSX content (paragraphs, texts, titles, etc.), never use ' or " - replace them with &apos; and &quot; for visual text only. Example: <p>Let's</p> should be <p>Let&apos;s</p>. Do NOT apply this to JSON files, variables, or configuration files - those should use regular quotes.

Always update the sitemap whenever there is a new page created
